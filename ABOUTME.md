I'm a Computer Engineering student at International Balkan University in North Macedonia, with hands-on experience in Java, C++, SQL, Python, and HTML-CSS through various workshops and some projects. Currently, Iâ€™m focusing on cyber-security and expanding my skills in protecting digital systems. In addition to my technical background, I manage professional Instagram profiles as a social media expert and designer, combining creativity with strategic thinking. I'm always eager to learn and take on new challenges in both the tech and other fields.
